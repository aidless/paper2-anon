Anonymous artifact bundle (double-blind review).

## Contents
- `source/` -- LaTeX manuscript and analysis code (compiles with the bundled `tmlr.sty`/`tmlr.bst`; `latexmk -pdf main.tex`).
- `evidence/` -- data, preregistrations, deviation records, and analysis outputs; `evidence_manifest.json` lists every file with its SHA-256.

## Verification
- Evidence hashes: recompute SHA-256 over each file in `evidence/` and compare with `evidence_manifest.json`.
- Manuscript: compile `source/main.tex` with TeX Live (the bundle includes the TMLR style files).

_This repository is anonymized for review; author identity will be restored at camera-ready._

## License

Code is MIT-licensed ([LICENSE](LICENSE)). Paper 2 releases the analyses and evidence files under `evidence/` under

GitHub's license detector reports this repository as `NOASSERTION` because it reads
a single SPDX id per repository and this one carries two. The split is deliberate:
the code stays permissively licensed so it can be reused, and the research material
stays attributable so a citation is required.
